# project

this repository contains two projects: one is my master's thesis project regarding insulator caps detection and segmentation using deep learning model named Mask R-CNN. it was run on googlr colab that is why some code seem like incomplete or having a problem. 
if you meet a problem, feel free to contact me. Another file, is a project regarding time series prediction. it was my assignment in big data course.
